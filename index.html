Longmont Mesh is a community group working to build a <a href="https://meshtastic.org/">Meshtastic</a> mesh network of solar-powered meshtastic radios in Longmont, Colorado, and surrouding areas.
This network acts like a free city-wide text messaging system, allowing people to communicate publicly or privately with anyone on the network. All of this happens without any external infrastructure - no power, no cell phone towers, no internet.
</p>
<p>
Longmont Mesh nodes use the default LONG-FAST settings and interoperates with <a href="https://denvermesh.org/">Denver Mesh</a>. This is achieved through Denver Mesh's strategic positioning of solar-power repeaters visible from Longmont. Please visit Denver Mesh for more details on:
<ul>
	<li>How to build nodes. Longmont Mesh recommends devices that use RAK wireless chips as these can be updated over bluetooth and generally have a longer operating life.</li>
	<ul>
		<li>Note that you can find a number of ready-made setups on Etsy.</li>
	</ul>
	<li>Joining Mattermost and talking with local community groups including</li>
	<ul>
		<li>Denver</li>
		<li>Longmont</li>
		<li>Fort Collins</li>
		<li>Colorado Springs</li>
	</ul>
</ul>
