Longmont Mesh is a community group working to build a <a href="https://meshtastic.org/">Meshtastic</a> mesh network of solar-powered meshtastic radios in Longmont, Colorado, and surrouding areas.
This network acts like a free city-wide text messaging system, allowing people to communicate publicly or privately with anyone on the network. All of this happens without any external infrastructure - no power, no cell phone towers, no internet.
</p>
<p>
Longmont Mesh nodes use the default LONG-FAST settings and interoperates with <a href="https://denvermesh.org/">Denver Mesh</a>. This is achieved through Denver Mesh's strategic positioning of solar-power repeaters visible from Longmont. For details on how to build your own nodes, and more information in general, please visit Denver Mesh. You can also find a number of ready-made setups on Etsy. We recommend devices that use RAK wireless chips as these can be updated over bluetooth and generally have a longer operating life.
</p>
<p> If you are located near Douglas & Elbert counties, and are an amateur radio operator, you will find their <a href="https://aresdec.org/lora-aprs/">LoRa APRS</a> site interesting.</p>

If you have any questions about the Longmont effort, please email Joey Stanford at nv0n@rmham.org or contact him on Denver Mesh's MatterMost instance.
